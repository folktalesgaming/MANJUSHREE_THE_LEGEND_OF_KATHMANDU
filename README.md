# MANJUSHREE - THE LEGEND OF KATHMANDU

Story based semi open game inspired by the legend of manjushree in Nepal and its capital Kathmandu.


## LORE

This game is inspired by the folklore/legend that is pretty famous in NEPAL, about a chinese monk named manjushree who came to nepal for the purpose of pilgrimage and found a beautiful lotus in the middle of a big lake *`(Currently the capital city of nepal, Kathmandu)`* and decided to cut the Chobar hill*`(Chobar gorge)`*. It is said the center of the lake where the lotus was is now the place where one of the famous stupa *`(Soyambhunath Stupa)`* is located.


> **DISCLAIMER**: While the game is inspired by the folklore of the manjushree, it is a fantasy genre game and alot of new elements are being added in order to make the game more enjoyable and playable.

While there are alot of things the legend suggest I have decided to cut down them due to storyline bloating and other reasons
